# Saddle Plants: March 5 - March 11

## Notes from class

Sarah and Nancy were present in class today.

#### Handling aspect

Courtney C. handled aspect in her models by converting aspect to radians, then converting these into Easting/Northing using sine and cosine. According to Tom, the side of the ridge on which the saddle rests is south facing, with some easting and westing in the plots.

What does aspect influence? Likely influences timing snowmelt. Through snowmelt it could influence soil moisture.

#### Site-wide measurements and finer-scale, spatially-explicit measurements

Variables which are non-significant in reduced models may have significant interactions with other variables. For example, aspect (a fine-scale variable) may interact with temperature to influence snow-depth. 

#### Solar radiation and temperature

Does solar radiation change from year to year? Can we take one year of solar radiation data and use that for all years? Nancy guesses that solar radiation varies between years but is more variable within a year than among years. Sarah says that temperature is likely more important than solar radiation.

Sarah says that some models feature time-lags in temperature, e.g., temperature in the four years previous as a covariate. This is worth considering for our models.

#### How to measure snow depth

Scott had previously been using kooky measures of cumulative snow measurements. This may work, but Sarah recommended instead looking at two metrics which she has found useful for previous Niwot projects: maximum snowdepth and day of snowmelt. Both may take some finessing to fit. Maximum snowdepth could perhaps be interpolated with a spline (Sarah recommended a cubic spline) or simply picked out of data, although picking the max in each year leaves us subject to variation in sampling effort among years. The day of snowmelt could be complicated by years where snow melts, then it snows again, etc. There is also, with varying sampling effort, some uncertainty presented in this day.

#### Evaluating models with prediction intervals

Using prediction intervals (a la Harris et al., 2018) may be a better way of evaluating models than RMSE, as they incorporate process error. Would this require fitting Bayesian models? I don't think so.
