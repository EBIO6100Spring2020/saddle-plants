#' <b>SAMPLING:</b> We decided to use the the NIWOT saddle grid data to answer our questions.
#' This grid was sampled intermittently since 1989 and annually or biannually 
#' since 2006.

#' We first wanted to know how sampling differed across the years in the data set.
#' Based on this information we excluded 1996 from our analysis

#'we also noticed sampling design seemed to vary. In some years middle hits were
#'taken and in others they were not. In some years top hits were recorded for every
#'plot but not in others.
#'
#'Ultimately we decide to isolate only the top hits and covert bottom only hits to top 
#'hits in the early years

#'<b>SNOW DEPTH:</b> early models showed that that there was a lot of variation in space,
#'with somewhat less in time.The only explanatory variable we had that varied in 
#'both space and time was snow depth. Snow depth was measured at stakes associated 
#'with each plot starting in March on a biweekly (mostly) schedule, producing a 
#'mountain of data.
#'
#'We felt the most biologically relavant data to be max depth and snow melt date.
#'Due to gaps in the data it was hard to estimate snow melt date reliably. Scott 
#'tried valiantly to fit GAMs to the snow data to allow us to estimate snow melts. 
#'But after several weeks and many discussions the GAMs grew too frustrating and we 
#'opted to use mean snow depth in June - simpler metric that still included some of
#'that information.
