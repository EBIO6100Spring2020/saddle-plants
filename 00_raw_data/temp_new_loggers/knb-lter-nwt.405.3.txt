    Climatological data were collected from the saddle climate station on Niwot Ridge (3525 m elevation) throughout the year. From 2000-06-24 to 2012-03-24, data were recorded using a Campbell Instruments CR23X data logger. Subsequently, data were recorded using a Campbell Instruments CR1000 data logger. Maximum and minimum values were recorded instantaneously, with a sampling interval of 5 seconds. Daily means and totals were calculated from 17,280 individual measurements. The CR23X logger was programmed to generate both hourly and daily output. The CR1000 logger generated daily, hourly, and minute data until September 2014, and 10 minute and minute data thereafter.

      The documentation section of this file was developed from the NWT LTER Cr21x data files metadata, as well as personal communication with Mark Losleben. The data file was put under sccs control on 2 December 2002. [TMA 02 December 2002] Data for 2002 were appended on 1 December 2004. [TMA 01 December 2004] Data for 2003 and 2004 were appended.[TMA 06 January 2005] Data for 2005 and 2006 were appended.[TMA 05 February 2008]  Data for 1 January 2007 through 7 September 2008 were appended to the data section.[TMA 9 February 2009] Data for 1 January 2008 through September 2008 were replaced and data for 1 January 2009 through December 31 2010 were appended to the data section.[HCH 12 December 2011] Data for 1 January 2011 through December 31 2012 were appended to the data section. Comments were added concerning the addition of cr1000 data to complete 2012-2013 data. NADP and UVB variables were removed. The abstract and comments were rewritten to reflect current IM practice and replacement of CR23X logger by CR1000.[HCH 12 December 2014] Data for 1 January 2013 through December 31 2013 were appended to the data section.[HCH 20 January 2015] The metadata and data ascii file names were changed to include "daily".[HCH 04 October 2015] Data for 2014 were appended. All "time of" variables were removed except time of max wind speed. Max and min variables for solar radiation, soil temp, and vol water content were also removed for consistency with 10 minute variables from which daily data were calculated starting 10 September 2014.[HCH 19 January 2016] Temperature units changed to celsius.[HCH 27 April 2017] Flag columns were added. Standard deviation of wind direction was omitted because the GCE Toolbox doesn't calculate standard deviation for angular variables. Soil moisture columns (previously vwc) were renamed.[HCH 23 February 2018] Data for 2014 through 2016 were appended; variables, keywords, methods, and columns were updated.[HCH 28 April 2018]Niwot metadata converted via script to EML[SCE 2018-09-17].Columns for new airtemp and rh measurements (hmp1, hmp2, hmp3) were added (note flagging of these new sensors has not been extensively tested and some issues may remain, notably with the rh sensor flags). Removed time_ws_max column. 2017 and 2018 data were appended [SCE/ATW 2019-07-15]Corrected EML root node; data unchanged [SCE 10 Oct 2019].

          The raw data files are archived in /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr23x and /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr1000 on the NWT LTER server. Prior to February 2010, the information from a web documentation form was incorporated into /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr23x/SDLCR23X.TXT. A copy of the raw file was then processed to separate hourly from daily records; hourly records were archived in /data1/Datman/Climdata/Cr23x/Hourly/Archive.
          Copies of the daily data files were provided to the climatologist for quality-checking. The information provided by the climatologist was then entered into the web documentation form and appended to the SDLCR23X.TXT file, and used to modify daily values for incorporation into this data set. Beginning in February 2010, the climatologist provided yearly/sub-yearly quality control information in Word documents that were the basis for modifying daily data values for this data set. CR23X hourly outputs are based on 5 second sample intervals, with 720 individual values.
          In December 2012, the CR23X logger was replaced with a CR1000 logger. Daily, hourly, and minute data were collected and archived in /data2/Datman/Rawarchive/Cr1000 on the NWT LTER server. Starting in September 2014, only 10 minute and minute data were collected by the CR1000 logger (in addition to a reduced set of hourly variables for graphing). The GCE Data Toolbox was used to conduct QAQC and to produce daily and hourly timestamps from the 10 minute data. Flag columns were added at this time. All flag column values were set to "n" for 2000 through September 2014 because no QAQC flagging was conducted during this time. Flag values: n=no flag; m=missing; q=questionable; e=estimated.

          Comments provided by Mark Losleben: soil moisture is relative only; the instrument has not been calibrated.
