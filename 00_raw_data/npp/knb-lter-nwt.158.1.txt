      Total aboveground biomass samples were collected as part of several studies
				conducted on Niwot Ridge between 1982 and 2011 and were combined into a single data set 
				that contains the name of the original investigator who collected the data, the URL of 
				the data offered on the Niwot Ridge website, the vegetation type, location, plot ID, 
				subsample ID, plot type, size (if known), year sample was collected, and live vascular 
				aboveground biomass. Contributing investigators were Marilyn Walker, Bill Bowman, Tim 
				Seastedt, Katie Suding, and Hope Humphries.
      NOTE: This LTER data portal display does not contain important maintenance/log
				information. Please be sure to view the EML file (a text file that contains XML
				tags) which is included in the zip archive (click on "Download zip archive") for
				legacy maintenance/log information pertaining to each dataset. The EML file name
				will have the following format: knb-lter-nwt.[3 digit dataset number].[version
				number].xml. Most web browsers can parse the EML so it's easier to read. Scroll down
