# Data readme

This file will catalog all of the data in this folder. I've copied and modified it from the sandbox repo.

### vegetation_sampling

This contains vegetation data from the NWT saddle for various years between the 1990s and the 2010s, with the most frequent sampling in the 2010s. This has some grid-sampling, with plenty of records across time of Deschampsia, Geum, and Kobresia.

Downloaded by SN on 30 Jan, explored in the sandbox repo. Look at `data_sandbox/nwt_saddle_veg_EDA_sn.R`.

### n_p_expmt

Dataset from experiment conducted throughout most years in the 1990s looking at effects of nitrogen and/or phosphorus addition at the saddle. Conducted at a site near but distinct from the saddle grid. This looks at all species but in particular has a lot of records from our focal species (although inconsistencies in sampling near the end precludes observations of one species). This may be useful for looking at effect sizes of Nitrogen change. This was analyzed in a paper Bill and (Terry I think?) put out in Ecology around 2000, but that paper appears to be mostly community-level analysis.
