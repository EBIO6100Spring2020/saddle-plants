      Air temperature data were collected on a daily time-scale from the Saddle climate station (3525 m) since 1981. Over time, various circumstances have led to days with missing values. Some of these values were estimated from redundant sensors and nearby climate stations. Greenland 1987 was a basis for the methodology; however when it was not possible to use this methodology, new methods were developed.

        The initial iteration of this file was generated by Todd Ackerman over the course of March - November 2006.  The file was put under sccs control on 15 November 2006.[TMA 15 November 2006] 2005 and 2006 data were appended to the data section.[TMA 21 February 2007] 2007 data were appended to the data section.[TMA 19 March 2008] 2008 data were appended.[TMA 9 February 2009] 2009 and 2010 data were appended. [HCH 11 December 2011] 2011 and 2012 data were appended; title, keywords, comments, and cols were edited. Dates were changed to yyyy-mm-dd and missing values to NaN.[HCH 30 June 2013] Data for 2013 were appended to the data section. Notes for 2013 were appended to the metadata section. Column labels were shortened and definitions added. [HCH 22 November 2014] Data and notes for 2014 were appended. [HCH 22 June 2015] Temperature units changed to celsius.[HCH 27 April 2017] Data for 2015 and 2016 were appended along with chart notes. LTER site and local site columns were added.[HCH 23 October 2017] Data for 2017 were appended along with chart notes. Column labels were changed to agree with logger labels.[HCH 31 March 2018]
