Tom update:

- Looked at trends in species over time by veg type - some interesting trends there
especially Kobresis increasing in dry meadows

- Also looked at highly variable plots by subsetting plots were Deschampsia increased/decreased by 20 
	
	- logic here - what would Deschampsia be replacing if anything?
	

- Veg classes - how are they calculated? Tom can ask Marco. Scott will check Ecosphere paper to see if code is there.

- If veg classes aren't available for every year maybe just use one year, e.g., see if what _was_ a dry meadow in 2010 is more likely to change than what was a wet meadow.

- Use a map of the veg class + elevation on the saddle.

	  - Use this map to see if the snow metrics make sense

# April 7, 2020

Zoom meeting, with Tom, Sean, and Scott present.

### Updates from last week:

####Tom: 

- figuring out average change in plots for plots which actually change

- maybe looking at plots with high coefficients of variation

	- look for directionality in tends of a species

- on to do list: spatial trends along with abiotic variables

	- spatial autocorrelation is one way to do this

	- animate this?

#### Scott:

Temperature:

- two datasets, neither complete, but probably can be combined to make a complete one

- max-mean average; species might prefer warmer/cooler

- read paper Tom sent

	- extremes seem to have a large effect

	- absolute metrics of extremes could be useful

- the newer dataset (logger one) has a lot of data (e.g., soil temp, wind speed)

- Talk with Sarah about temperature because she is working on this now

	- could also talk with Courtney

- Could maybe build models which relate temperature to soil temp, solar radiation, etc. to maybe get pre-2000 measurements of things missing from the logger data

- maybe do variance partitioning

	- mean temp over growing season

	- GDD

- Need to consider lags and time effects...

	- looking at time-lags

	- it's because the growth/shrinkage of one of these species depends on fecundity/veg growth in a given species


- Veg class stuff - Marco's thing came from Hope Humphries, used 88 classificaiton

- Gam: maybe fit only from maximum depth onward? We're mostly interested in the shape of the curve as the snow melts, not as it accumulates...

- Temporal autocorrelation; e.g., DECE's abundance in 2006 probably affects its abundance in 2007...

### Next steps

Sean: will read papers collected
Tom: will look into spatial autocorrelation (Fletcher & Fortin?)
Scott: continue with gams and temperature stuff
