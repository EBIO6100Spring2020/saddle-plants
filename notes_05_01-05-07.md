# May 1, 2020

A prep meeting for our presentation on May 7. Present: Sean, Tom, Scott.

##### What we want to talk about

- Pika info? Put something together and then ask Chris early next week
	- early worry was Geum would lose out to Desch with env. change

- One or two documents: one for background (?), one for exploration, one for final model
	- we should be open to seeking future advice
	
- Markdown, Rmarkdown, or plain R?
	- give markdown a try, ditch it if it's taking too much effort
	- could also try Rmarkdown as a pdf
	- have a script ready to run through stuff on the fly

- Outline?
	- Intro
	- Data availablity and exploration
	- Maybe slightly stuff on model selection
	- Final results, present models
	- Next steps: veg classes, within-plot data

##### Results so far

- Nitrogen
	- Kobresia is negatively affected - good, this is found elsewhere
	- No strong evidence of effect on other species from model
	- Prior assumption was DECE influenced N
	- could be washing out some spatial nutrient variation

##### Other things

- Try to meet with Brett
	- Things Brett has said previously	
		- we could try to predict in space?
		- Thresholds/nonlinear response (positive feedback loop) not in model so far (could be done with point-level data wthin plot)

- Try to incorporate veg class
	- use 95 veg class as a random intercept, slope
	- would allow us to assess change within initial veg type. Would be cool!

##### Next steps

Try to meet on Monday? Tuesday at latest. Try to get Brett involved.

- Sean: try to come up with intro
- Tom: can aggregate exploration stuff, put it into a file
	- want: what plots look like
	- then cover, then veg class, temperature, snow
- Scott: finish running models, have a first pass at what a final pres would look like
