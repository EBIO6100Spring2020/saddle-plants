# Species modeling scripts

This subdirectory will be used for fitting models to understand or at least predict species abundance patterns. This directory will not be used for generating predictions.

### Individual species linear models

Courtney Collins recommended giving fitting individual species models using linear models, as this may be more efficient (and easier to interpret) than fitting joint SDMs with these species. Right now there's a script, `veg_one_species_lmms.R` which does (will do) this. All three of our focal species will be modeled in this script.
