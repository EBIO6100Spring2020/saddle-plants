#'Snow depth: early models showed that that there was a lot of variation in space,
#'with somewhat less in time.The only explanatory variable we had that varied in 
#'both space and time was snow depth. Snow depth was measured at stakes associated 
#'with each plot starting in March on a biweekly (mostly) schedule, producing a 
#'mountain of data.
#'
#'We felt the most biologically relavant data to be max depth and snow melt date.
#'Due to gaps in the data it was hard to estimate snow melt date reliably. Scott 
#'tried valiantly to fit GAMs to the snow data to allow us to estimate snow melts. 
#'But after several weeks and many discussions the GAMs grew too frustrating and we 
#'opted to use mean snow depth in June - simpler metric that still included some of
#'that information.
#'
#'We were able use temperature data at the site level from the saddle data logger.
#'This provided us with a wealth of data at a fine temporal scale.
